### Manifest

According to [developer.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest) :
> The web app **manifest** is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when 'installed' on the users mobile device or desktop

According to [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) :
> The web app **manifest** provides information about an application (such as its name, author, icon, and description) in a JSON text file. The manifest informs details for websites installed on the homescreen of a device, providing users with quicker access and a richer experience

#### How to use it ?

Add the following code to the Head section of your document

``<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">``

Next step ? go a head and create a that file in that path :)

#### What are the properties of Manifest ?
* **background_color**
    
    According to [developer.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest#background-color) :
    > The **background_color** property is used on the splash screen when the application is first launched.
    
    According to [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#background_color) :
    > Defines the expected **background color** for the website. This value repeats what is already available in the siteâ€™s CSS, but can be used by browsers to draw the background color of a shortcut when the manifest is available before the stylesheet has loaded. This creates a smooth transition between launching the web application and loading the site's content.
    
    ``"background_color": "red"``
